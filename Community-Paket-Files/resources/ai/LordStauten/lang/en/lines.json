  "description": "Savine is a socialite, investor, and the daughter of Arch Lector Glokta, the most powerful man in the Union.

She uses her status at court, bribery, blackmail, and industrial espionage to her advantage. While trained in sword fighting, she prefers to keep her hands clean.",

  "no_attack_2": "Running straight at the enemy? That’s not always the smartest move. Have some patience.",

  "sent": "An opportunity for investment? Who would I be if I let that slip by?",
  "team_winning": "There are things a decent man would never do… but that’s why you have me!",
